# SingleLinkedList
Single linked list library created in C++

Created for my Advanced Software Engineering course for my 3rd year of university which resulted in a 2.1.
The module focused on algorithmic complexity and standard datastructures.

Based on the singally linked list data structure.

Main features
  Efficient use of pointers
  Operation overrides to turn the default move and copy functions into their deep counterparts
  Use of standard functions and recursive worker functions instead of standard looping
